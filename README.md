# üöó AutoCertify ‚Äì Blockchain-Based Vehicle Supply Chain Tracker

![AutoCertify Cover](https://i.ibb.co/j9SM9x5c/Auto-Certify-1.png)

AutoCertify is a blockchain-powered, decentralized vehicle lifecycle tracker that utilizes Ethereum smart contracts and NFTs to ensure transparency, trust, and tamper-proof vehicle history records. Designed as part of a capstone project, this platform reimagines how vehicle ownership, crash history, and service data can be recorded and verified.

## Tech Stack

| Layer          | Technology                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Frontend       | Next.js                     |
| Smart Contract | Solidity, Hardhat           |
| Wallet         | MetaMask                    |
| Testing        | Mocha, Chai                 |

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AutoCertifyOrg/AutoCertify.git
cd AutoCertify
```

### 2. Smart Contract Setup

Clean previous builds:

```bash
npx hardhat clean
```

Compile smart contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

Start the local Hardhat network:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

> This creates a local Ethereum network with 20 test accounts.  
> The **first account** is considered the **admin** and is used for deploying contracts.

Deploy the contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

> This will generate ABI files and deploy the contracts locally.

---

##  MetaMask Setup

- Add a custom network in MetaMask:
  - **Network Name**: Hardhat Local
  - **RPC URL**: http://127.0.0.1:8545
  - **Chain ID**: 1337
- Import one of the test account private keys shown in your terminal after running `npx hardhat node`.

---

## Frontend Setup

If this is your first time:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Testing

Test cases are located in the `test/` directory and cover:

- NFT Minting and Ownership

- Role Access Restrictions

- Crash and Service Logging

- Ownership Transfers

To run tests:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

---

## Challenges Faced

- ‚ùå Initially planned integration with **Hyperledger FireFly** was paused due to wallet accounts and ether hurdles.

- ‚öôÔ∏è Transitioned to **Hardhat** for a more developer-friendly, local testing and simulation environment.

- üîó Future-ready architecture built to scale for **Ethereum Mainnet** deployment.
